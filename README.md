#TextLauncher

A fork of that launcher from here: https://gitlab.com/ademar111190/textlauncher
I removed unecessary values directories from app/src/main/res (in my case) and app search field. I don't know programming that much so I used Android Studio to modify source code. There might be some unecessary bloat in code due to usage of "smart implementation" feature in Android Studio.
